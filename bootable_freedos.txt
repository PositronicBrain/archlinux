How to boot iso images for firmware updates
===========================================
Most firmware updates are released as iso images, how to boot the from a
usb stick?

In particular I wanted to update the
[firmware](http://knowledge.seagate.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/223651en) of my
seagete hard drive. The file provided was `Barracuda-ALL-GRCC4H.iso`.

Procedure is:

   * install syslinux and unetbootin
   * use unetbootin to install freedos to the usb stick
   * mount the stick
   * copy  /usr/lib/syslinux/memdisk to the root of the usb

Fineally edit the file syslinux.cfg and add

    label SeaTools
    linux memdisk
    initrd Barracuda-ALL-GRCC4H.iso
    append iso

In my particular case I needed to do one further step. Change in the bios
settings the controller for the hard drive frop sata to ide mode.
