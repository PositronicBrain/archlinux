Partitioning and creating filesystem on the Seagate 3Tb
=======================================================

Partition was made with cgdisk. It sets the alignment to 1Mb. This is is
fine both for hd (multiple of 4k) and for ssd (multiple of 512k).
We can check that everything is fine with parted:

    $ sudo parted /dev/sdb
    GNU Parted 3.1
    Using /dev/sdb
    Welcome to GNU Parted! Type 'help' to view a list of commands.
    (parted) u s
    (parted) p
    Model: ATA ST3000DM001-9YN1 (scsi)
    Disk /dev/sdb: 5860533168s
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/4096B
    Partition Table: gpt
    Disk Flags:

    Number  Start  End          Size         File system  Name         Flags
     1      2048s  5860533134s  5860531087s               BIGSTORAGE2

    (parted)

Notes:
    * (5860533168-1) - 5860533134 = 33
      This is becasue gpt writes the partition table at the beginning and at the
      end of the disk, using 33 sectors for each.
    * 2048*512 = 1048576. Partition is aligned to 1Mb


This is the mkfs command issued:

     $ sudo mkfs.btrfs -l 16384 -n 16384 -LBIGSTORAGE2 /dev/sdb1
     [sudo] password for federico:
     
     WARNING! - Btrfs Btrfs v0.19 IS EXPERIMENTAL
     WARNING! - see http://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org before using
     
     fs created label BIGSTORAGE2 on /dev/sdb1
         nodesize 16384 leafsize 16384 sectorsize 4096 size 2.73TB
     Btrfs Btrfs v0.19


Note:

  * Sector size is automatically seto to the correct value for modern hd (4k)

  * Since [Kernel
    3.5](http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_3.4#head-f858c75d1191ae947cf134622606a97c53917dcb)
    leafsize and nodesize can be set to a value different than 4k. I set them
    to 16kb according to this
    [thread](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.btrfs/19440)


Finally the command to create the
[raid](https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Using_Btrfs_with_Multiple_Devices):

        $ sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/Storage/
        [federico @ localhost ~]
        $ sudo btrfs device add /dev/sdc1 /media/Storage/
        [federico @ localhost ~]
        $
        [federico @ localhost ~]
        $ sudo btrfs balance start -dconvert=raid1 -mconvert=raid1 /media/Storage/
        Done, had to relocate 1202 out of 1202 chunks
        [federico @ localhost ~]
        $

and add the following lines to /etc/fstab
